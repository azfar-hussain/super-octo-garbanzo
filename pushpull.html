    <h1>Push-Pull Dynamics</h1>

    <p>According to some behavioral experts, a person’s core character solidifies early in life. Yet, when we look closely, we see that all human beings are fundamentally alike in certain ways and distinctly different in others.</p>

    <p>Nature grants each of us unique talents, tendencies, and inclinations. Society, however, constantly tries to sort and box us into standardized categories.</p>

    <p>This creates an ongoing push-pull tension between who we truly are and the demands of social life. At one extreme, we crave deeply personalized experiences (such as tailored education or precision medicine); at the other, we’re pushed toward uniform, one-size-fits-all systems and services.</p>
