        <h1>GTD: A Critical Look</h1>

        <p>We’ve already explored the Eisenhower Matrix and some basic principles of personal productivity. At this point, you might wonder: where does Getting Things Done (GTD) fit in? The short answer is that GTD doesn’t include a built-in way to decide what’s most important right now. That’s why it almost always works best alongside other frameworks, not in isolation.</p>

        <p>Any effective system hides its complexity behind the scenes. The user-facing part should feel simple, intuitive, and tailored to the person’s role—never more complicated than it needs to be. Productivity methods are no different.</p>

        <p>When priorities are crystal clear and the necessary details of each task have been spelled out, we gain three useful abilities:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>accurately estimating completion time when someone asks for a commitment,</li>
            <li>giving realistic progress updates as we go, and</li>
            <li>staying aware of the full workload without dropping balls.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>At its core, GTD is a complete workflow—from capturing everything that has your attention, through clarifying what it means and what to do about it, all the way to execution. Its primary promise is to eliminate the mental drag and overwhelm that come from carrying too much in your head.</p>

        <blockquote>
            So how do we fairly judge whether GTD is the right process for us?
        </blockquote>

        <p>Here are the key questions worth tracking:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>How much does it reduce planning overhead and mental clutter?</li>
            <li>Does it actually speed up real work?</li>
            <li>Quick litmus test: Are we spending the majority of our time in focused execution, or does maintaining the system itself start to dominate?</li>
            <li>What happens to the quality and volume of output? Do we need fewer revisions because things were thought through earlier?</li>
            <li>How easily does GTD integrate (or “loosely couple”) with other tools and methods we already use?</li>
        </ul>

        <p>In the end, no productivity system is universally perfect—your role, workload, and personal style will heavily influence whether GTD feels like a liberating foundation or just another layer of bureaucracy.</p>
