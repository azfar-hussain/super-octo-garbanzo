        Steve Jobs’ 2005 Stanford Commencement Address
    </a>
</p>

<p>Steve Jobs’ 2005 Stanford commencement address (not 2015) is a timeless masterpiece built entirely around one core idea: <strong>follow your heart</strong>.</p>

<p>To truly follow your heart, you need a deep confidence—an almost irrational trust—that the choices you’re making today, even when they seem random or risky, will somehow make sense later. As Jobs famously said, you can only connect the dots looking backward, never forward. In the moment, when you step off the conventional path, there’s no data from the past to prove it will work out. The future is pure uncertainty, so the question “What good will this do?” rarely has a clear answer. You just have to trust.</p>

<p>And what does following your heart actually give you? Beyond new experiences and genuine well-being, it does something far more precious: it <em>liberates</em> you. It releases you from the trap of other people’s expectations, from the paralyzing fear of failure, and—most importantly—from the quiet tragedy of living someone else’s life.</p>

<p>When you love what you do, you steer your own ship with integrity. Without that love, boredom and emptiness creep in, and suddenly you’re chasing approval from others, losing your inner compass and your self-reliance.</p>

<p>Jobs himself lived this. Getting fired from Apple felt like devastating public failure, yet because he loved what he did, he kept going. That love shielded him from bitterness and eventually turned apparent loss into the foundation of his greatest creative period. The dots connected again—later.</p>

<p>So how do you summon the courage to keep following your heart when everything looks bleak? Jobs offered a simple, brutal tool:</p>

<blockquote>
    Every day ask yourself, “If today were the last day of my life, would I want to do what I’m about to do today?”
</blockquote>

<p>Almost nothing clarifies priorities like remembering you’re going to die. The pharaohs built pyramids, the gurus sought enlightenment—everyone tries to cheat death somehow. Jobs’ question does the opposite: it forces you to live fully in light of death. It strips away ego, dogma, and petty opinions. It makes you open, adaptable, and hungry again.</p>

<p>Loss, in this light, isn’t just pain to endure. It’s death’s close cousin—and nature’s way of clearing space for renewal. What feels like the end is often the beginning of something truer.</p>

<p>In three short stories, Jobs wove together autonomy (trusting your own path), competence (loving what you do so much that you become great at it), and connection (understanding that even death gives life meaning)—all orbiting the single commanding idea: <strong>follow your heart, no matter what</strong>.</p>

<p>It remains one of the most powerful lessons ever given on human motivation and how to live a life that actually feels like yours.</p>
