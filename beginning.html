    <h2>Beginning</h2>

    <blockquote>
        The ancient wisdom of Heraclitus reminds us, <strong>"No man ever steps in the same river twice. For it's not the same river and he's not the same man."</strong>
    </blockquote>

    <p>This profound maxim challenges our understanding of life and existence. Just as the water in a river constantly changes—sometimes rushing, sometimes calm—everything in our world is in a state of flux. This highlights the fundamentally <strong>transient (impermanent) nature of existence</strong>.</p>

    <p>So, how do we best navigate this ever-changing reality?</p>

    <p>The key is adopting a <strong>Beginner's Mindset</strong>. This means approaching every circumstance with a completely <strong>fresh outlook</strong>, actively seeking novelty in each situation. We must recognize that we are always in new terrain, remaining curious enough to make observations and willing to test or *unravel* the assumptions and predictions our minds automatically generate. We hold these assumptions lightly, even when they seem helpful, to see what new ones emerge and how things actually unfold.</p>

    <p>Emotionally, we should cultivate the **curiosity of a cat**, resisting the immediate urge to accept the first conclusion our mind offers.</p>
