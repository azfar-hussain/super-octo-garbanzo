    <p>The cognitive triangle is a powerful and intuitive framework that shows how three interconnected elements—thoughts, feelings, and behaviors—work together in every situation to shape our experience (and how others experience us). Ultimately, our sense of control and well-being rests on this triangle and on how we engage with it.</p>

    <p>Of the three components, thoughts and behaviors are usually the most accessible entry points for creating positive change. When we intentionally shift our thinking or our actions, more positive emotions naturally follow.</p>

    <p>In essence, the model reveals the cyclical nature of our inner world: each element continuously influences the others. By starting with whichever part feels easiest to adjust in the moment, we can gently guide ourselves toward the emotional state we want to inhabit.</p>

    <p>This deliberate inner work—observing and adjusting the triangle—is especially valuable during life transitions, helping us navigate change with greater awareness and agency.</p>
