    <h1>Be Water, My Friend</h1>

    <p>The phrase “Be water, my friend” frequently appears on social media, and for good reason: it captures something profound about human potential by inviting us to emulate the qualities of water as we observe it in nature.</p>

    <p>In daily life we constantly encounter conflict—politicians battling for power, corporations fighting for market dominance, or, on a smaller scale, rickshaw pullers arguing over fares and street vendors haggling with customers. What can water teach us in such moments? When water meets a massive, immovable rock, it doesn’t fight head-on; it simply flows around it. This isn’t avoidance or weakness. It is intelligent engagement. Water acknowledges the obstacle, adapts its shape, and keeps moving—often, over time, reshaping the obstacle itself. Rivers have carved canyons; droplets have worn down stone. Softness and persistence triumph where force fails.</p>

    <p>We also ride endless emotional waves. Some days they crash like tsunamis, threatening to drown us in anger, grief, or excitement. The goal is not to suppress feeling—after all, to feel is human—but to learn to surf these waves skillfully until the mind settles into the calm clarity of a still lake. Even a lake can ripple or storm in a teacup; perfect stillness is rare. Yet only when the surface is quiet can we see clearly to the bottom. Inner peace is not the absence of disturbance; it is the mastery of it.</p>

    <p>Our bodies are roughly seventy percent water, and water is the foundation of all life on Earth. We exist in constant symbiosis with countless microorganisms, plants, animals, and ecosystems—all sustained by the same molecule. This reminds us of a deeper truth: no one is truly separate. Our well-being is tied to the well-being of the soil, the rain, the bees, the forests, and every living being. True connection extends far beyond family and friends; it embraces the entire web of life.</p>

    <p>Buddhism teaches impermanence—anicca—the truth that everything changes. Water is the perfect symbol: it has no fixed shape. Pour it into a cup and it becomes the cup; into a bottle and it becomes the bottle; into a teapot and it becomes the teapot. It flows or it crashes, yielding yet unstoppable.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>Be water, my friend. Empty your mind. Be formless, shapeless, like water. You put water into a cup, it becomes the cup. You put water into a bottle, it becomes the bottle. You put it into a teapot, it becomes the teapot. Now water can flow or it can crash. Be water, my friend.</p>
