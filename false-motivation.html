  <h1>The Lure of False Motivation: Finding Real Drive</h1>

  <p>When we introduce external rewards, <span class="highlight">goal dilution</span> occurs. We stop pursuing tasks for their inherent value and instead chase the rewards themselves, which feel more immediately gratifying and take priority.</p>

  <p>This mirrors how people respond when they're sold something unnecessary—the extrinsic incentive overshadows the original purpose.</p>

  <p>The solution lies in either <strong>re-framing how we think about rewards</strong> or deploying them strategically.</p>

  <p>We're often tempted to rely on external incentives because they create an illusion of control, but this sense of control is temporary rather than lasting. Worse, it tends to elicit only <em>minimal effort</em>—just enough to claim the reward.</p>

  <p>To counteract this, we must deliberately re-frame our relationship with rewards whenever extrinsic motivation enters the picture, ensuring they <strong>support rather than replace</strong> our intrinsic drive.</p>
