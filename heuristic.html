<h1>A Golden Heuristic</h1>

<blockquote>
    <p>“Always produce” is one of the most powerful heuristics for discovering the work you truly love. When you force yourself to live by this rule, it naturally repels you from the things you feel you <em>should</em> do and pulls you toward the things that genuinely excite you. Like water following gravity to find the exact leak in your roof, relentless production will guide you—almost inevitably—to your life’s work.</p>
    <cite>— Paul Graham, <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/love.html">How to Do What You Love</a></cite>
</blockquote>

<p>Embracing this discipline is undeniably hard. It demands steady, sometimes grueling effort. Yet it is also profoundly liberating because it frees you from a cluster of comforting but false beliefs we tend to hold about work and other people—chief among them the idea that everyone else has already figured out what they love, either because they’re more self-aware or more confident than we are.</p>

<p>From the outside, it can look that way. But a clearer picture emerges when you start seeing work not as something you need to “find” once and for all, but as the very process that builds self-awareness and competence—and, through them, genuine confidence.</p>

<h3>The usual obstacles</h3>

<p>The main enemies of consistent production are familiar: fear, doubt, boredom, and laziness.</p>

<p><strong>Fear</strong> shows up as anxiety whenever we face change. The bigger or more effortful the change, the stronger the anxiety. Unchecked, it feeds doubt, which in turn erodes motivation. The antidote is to regularly reconnect with your deeper “why.” Even the things we love need periodic renewal of purpose; otherwise we drift. This habit also protects you from pouring months or years into something whose meaning has quietly faded.</p>

<p><strong>Boredom</strong> strikes when an activity feels meaningless, when attention wanders, or both—and yes, scientists confirm these two causes often appear together. Nobody gets excited about folding laundry in the abstract, but linking it to the satisfaction of a clean, orderly home can make it bearable (or even satisfying). The same principle applies to any repetitive or seemingly dull task. One practical fix that has worked for generations: structure your day with focused effort blocks followed by real breaks. It doesn’t eliminate boredom, but it keeps it from derailing you completely.</p>

<p><strong>Laziness</strong>, some say, has no cure—and in a sense they’re right. Our brains evolved to conserve energy; avoiding unnecessary effort is baked into the wiring. Every potential task is instantly judged on three dimensions: how long it will take, how hard it will be, and how much it matters. That’s why habits and routines are so powerful: once established, they bypass the constant cost-benefit debate. The smart move, then, isn’t to fight laziness head-on but to build systems and rituals that carry you forward even when motivation is low.</p>

<p>In the end, “always produce” is less a romantic ideal than a practical filter. Keep making things—day after day—and the signal of what you truly love will grow louder while the noise of obligation fades away.</p>
