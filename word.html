<h1>As Per Word...</h1>

<p>The true extent of your <em>agency</em>—your real ability to shape your life and the world around you—depends far less on personal qualities alone and much more on the <span class="highlight">social currencies</span> you command: status, fame, power, and wealth.</p>

<p>You can be extraordinarily creative, influential, brilliant, hardworking, resilient, and fiercely independent. Yet these traits remain largely <em>potential</em>—subjective and unproven—until they are converted into tangible social currency. That conversion only happens when you step into the arena and engage with the world.</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>A word of caution: chasing status, fame, power, or wealth purely for their own sake is dangerous. It breeds short-term thinking and fragile foundations, because all social currencies are fleeting by nature.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So what truly lasts? What is worth pursuing?</p>

<p><strong>Character growth and personal development.<br>
The deliberate choice to seek out challenges that forge you.</strong></p>

<p>These are the only things that endure.</p>
