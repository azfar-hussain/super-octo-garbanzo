        <h1>Interesting Parallels …</h1>
        
        <p>
            If you're familiar with Jung, you can't miss the striking parallel: just as the <span class="highlight">Collective Unconscious</span> provides an inherited, archetypal foundation shaped over generations, <span class="highlight">Large Language Models</span> are trained on vast cultural data, embedding collective human knowledge into their architecture.
        </p>
        <p>
            While AI does not learn continuously in deployment, its training process — absorbing patterns at scale, integrating them into latent representations, and inferring outputs — deliberately mirrors how societal and natural forces inform the psyche.
        </p>
        <p>
            The key difference: Jung’s Collective Unconscious is <em>a priori</em>, slow-evolving, and transpersonal, while AI’s "collective" is engineered, rapidly updated (between versions), and static post-training.
