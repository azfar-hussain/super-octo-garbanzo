        <p>
            It is a fundamental human tendency to be impulsive, especially during moments of "lows" or periods of continuous seeking. This drive often leads us to engage in risk-taking behavior, including unnecessary or unplanned expenditure.
        </p>

        <h2>Cognitive Tools for Self-Control</h2>
        <p>
            Fortunately, we can counter this impulsivity using two powerful cognitive strategies:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Cognitive Appraisals:</strong> Re-evaluating the value and consequence of an action.</li>
            <li><strong>Implementation Intentions:</strong> Pre-planning a response to a specific situation (e.g., "If X happens, then I will do Y").</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Example: Adam, the Impulsive Foodie</h2>
        <div class="example-box">
            <h3>Sample Cognitive Appraisal:</h3>
            <p class="appraisal-text">
                "Spending money on yummy food is like exchanging wealth for a reward. The human brain, like that of other mammals, craves and creates reward signals. However, as I splurge my hard-earned money inadvertently, my overall reward potential gets lesser and lesser. In order to keep as many fulfilling rewards as possible, I need to address this unnecessary expenditure."

        <h2>Key Takeaway</h2>
        <p>
            The goal is to reframe how we view rewards. Humans naturally pursue goals for the inherent reward, but the best type of reward enriches us; it doesn't deplete our resources. We must analyze and compare instant gratification against delayed gratification to determine where our actions truly lead.
