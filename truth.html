    <h1>Truth Seeking in a Noisy World</h1>

    <h2>Is It True?</h2>

    <blockquote>
        “Yes, Kalamas, it is right for you to doubt, to feel uncertain, because doubt has arisen about something that is truly doubtful. Come, Kalamas: do not accept things just because of hearsay, tradition, or what people say. Do not accept them merely because they come from scripture, from clever reasoning, from how things appear, from liking certain ideas, from probabilities, or because ‘this is my teacher’. Instead, Kalamas, when you yourselves know clearly: ‘These things are harmful, wrong, and blamed by the wise,’ reject them. And when you yourselves know clearly: ‘These things are beneficial, right, and praised by the wise,’ then take them up and live by them.”

    <p>This ancient advice from the Buddha almost completely lists every way we normally come to believe something: reports, customs, second-hand stories, sacred books, logical arguments, surface impressions, pet theories, wishful thinking, or loyalty to a guru.</p>

    <p>In our age, we are drowning in a flood of information that doesn’t just reach us—it overwhelms and confuses us. The solution is not to throw out all of these sources; it’s to test whatever comes our way and only then decide what to accept. Ranking any single source as the ultimate authority misses the point. What actually counts is whether we personally verify claims through honest, careful investigation.</p>

    <p>Of course, not every “truth” carries the same weight. Some matter far more than others. The responsibility rests squarely on each of us. Yet in our rushed, busy lives, we rarely have the time or energy to dig deeply into everything that deserves scrutiny. The daily grind leaves little
