    <h1>Conflict</h1>

    <p>Many of us living in developing or third-world countries like Pakistan have been fed a steady diet of official national narratives. These stories, pushed by those in power, are presented as a protective shield strong enough to keep the chaos of the wider world at bay. In reality, this does enormous harm to the truth (which, as we all know, is always the first casualty when propaganda takes over).</p>

    <p>Yet if we look at things pragmatically, the clash between opposing ideologies doesn’t have to remain a destructive fight. Like the yin and yang of the Tao, it can become a complementary, dynamic balance. This tension offers a remarkable creative opportunity: a chance to reconcile viewpoints that seem irreconcilable, whether in life or in business. When handled wisely, these competing ideas bring genuine harmony while still grappling with the uncertainty and disorder that dominate our modern world.</p>

    <p>On a personal level, embracing conflict breeds humility. It reminds us that no one has all the answers, and that each of us is simply trying (however imperfectly) to bring more sincerity and purpose to a world that often feels devoid of both.</p>

    <p>So, isn’t conflict ultimately a good thing? It sparks creativity. It gets the juices flowing.</p>
