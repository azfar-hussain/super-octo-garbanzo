        <p>The concept of transforms in disciplines like Signals and Systems is profound, much like the deceptive simplicity of Plato's Allegory of the Cave. Both illustrate how our direct perceptions can be misleading.</p>

        <p>In life, our perspective is often clouded by cognitive biases and the "obviousness" of what we see. Emotions particularly add strong color to our mental landscape, making objective observation difficult.</p>

        <p>To gain clarity, the key skill is to neutralize strong emotions when they arise.</p>

        <h2>The Strategy: Diffuse, Process, and Reflect</h2>
        <ul class="strategy-list">
            <li>
                Diffuse &amp; Defer: When overwhelmed, delay emotional processing. Create a mental distance between yourself and your feelings in the moment.
            </li>
            <li>
                Process &amp; Reflect: Revisit those feelings later, when you are calm. This shift in time and space allows for a more objective, level-headed understanding of the situation.
