        <h1>Am I in the loop?</h1>
        
        <p>The first step toward real freedom is simply noticing how much of our attention is being steered by invisible cues in the environment.</p>
        
        <p>How do you catch yourself being cued? Watch for sudden, unexplained shifts in what feels urgent or important. When your priorities quietly rearrange themselves—when something that mattered yesterday suddenly doesn’t, or something trivial jumps to the top of the list—that’s almost always a sign that a hidden cue has bypassed your conscious filters.</p>
