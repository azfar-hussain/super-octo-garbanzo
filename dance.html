<h1>Dance</h1>

<div class="poem">
A thing happens, then another
Our thoughts succumb to the other
If they don't, they imbibe our color
Lead us to act without a mirror
If we get back our senses, we picture
How could we avoid a moment of despair
Yes, a moment of repair before a moment of despair
Yes, a moment to distract before a moment of repair
All possible, however, sigh, reactive we were
Shadows on the walls we were
Sigh, afraid of ourselves we were
Sigh, each one could have talked to the other
That in my view would have been proper
We must, in spite of this, listen to ourselves and to the others
Forge whatever, that is now, and worthy to cheer!
To create whatever is worthy and also dear!
As whatever is now, will become rear
And Lo and Behold! what we felt distant becomes near!
As with awe we come to bear!
