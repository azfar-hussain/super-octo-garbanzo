    <h1>Endings & Beginnings</h1>
    <h2>A quiet passage worth reflecting on</h2>

    <p>Life has a gentle (or sometimes abrupt) way of showing us what truly matters. What feels urgently important in the moment is often just a distraction from the deeper work we’re here to do. If we drift through life half-asleep, rarely pausing for honest self-reflection, these reminders can arrive like earthquakes. When we’re fortunate and disciplined enough to live by well-considered values, we find our way back to the path more gracefully.</p>

    <p>I rarely like to sound prescriptive, yet this passage stirred something in me—enough to shape my thoughts as I write my customary end-of-year reflection (this one for the close of 2023).</p>

    <h3>One who stands on tiptoe cannot stand steady.</h3>
    <p>Without a clear inner compass or deeply held values, a person becomes a weather vane—spun by every external signal, every opinion, every fear of disapproval. In trying not to offend or disappoint anyone, we abandon our own ground. (External input isn’t inherently bad, but swallowing it whole leaves us wide open to manipulation.)</p>

    <h3>One who races ahead does not go far.</h3>
    <p>Fear or greed creates false urgency. We rush, we hoard, we over-control, and in doing so we confuse a single tree for the entire forest. Everything is connected. A decision made in isolation ripples outward, affecting relationships, reputation, and the quiet wisdom that only community and nature can offer. Long journeys demand the long view.</p>

    <h3>One who strains to shine only dims his own light.</h3>
    <p>The brain is wired to conserve energy. Constantly reshaping yourself to match what others admire is exhausting. When your inner values clash with the performance you’re giving, motivation drains away. You’ll meet thousands of people in a lifetime—save your vitality for the few who matter, or better yet, for the person whose values already align with the life you’re building.</p>

    <h3>One who defines himself too rigidly will never truly know himself.</h3>
    <p>Healthy boundaries matter, but growth happens when we stretch them. As long as we cling to the safety of the familiar, terrified of change or the unknown, we’ll never discover what we’re actually capable of. Real self-knowledge comes from stepping into new challenges and choosing to become more than we were.</p>

    <h3>One who holds power over others cannot empower himself.</h3>
    <p>Pursue mastery, not dominance. Power over people can get things done, but it’s rooted in fear. Mastery is rooted in understanding—first of yourself, then of the world. Because we’re all interwoven, true command of any situation begins with self-command. Self-mastery lifts everyone around you; it’s the upward spiral toward greater harmony.</p>

    <h3>One who clutches his work creates nothing that lasts.</h3>
    <p>No creation is perfect forever, for every audience, in every era. Enduring work stays alive only through continual evolution. It must spring from a deep feel for human and natural truths. Skills can be taught; timeless relevance cannot. The moment a piece of work—or an idea, or a plan—outlives its usefulness, the courageous move is to let it go.</p>

    <h3>If you wish to walk with the Dao, do your work well—then release it.</h3>
    <p>Our clearest improvements often appear only after something is “finished,” when feedback arrives or distance reveals what was hidden. Real refinement means cutting away what’s cherished but outdated, adding what’s newly needed, and amplifying what works. Attachment is natural after long effort, yet one of the greatest skills we can cultivate is knowing when to step back and let the work (or part of it) go.</p>

    <hr>

    <p class="closing">May the endings of this year clear space for quieter, truer beginnings.</p>
