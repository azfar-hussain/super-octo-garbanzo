<h1>Dreamer or Accountant?</h1>

<p class="lead">In life, we often approach things in one of two ways: like a dreamer, full of vision and imagination, or like an accountant, focused on practicality, numbers, and limits. Most of the time, we’re a mix of both. Each mindset has its strengths, and the real challenge is knowing when to lean into dreaming and when to switch to calculating.</p>

<p>Ideally—both in terms of time spent and depth of fulfillment—we would devote most of our days to pursuing what truly excites us, our biggest dreams and passions. But in reality, that rarely happens.</p>

<p>When it comes to the projects closest to our hearts, we too often get distracted, pulled away by urgent tasks, or simply procrastinate. At night, as we lie in bed, those dreams resurface. We comfort ourselves with grand visions just before falling asleep, but they remain fantasies—beautiful, yet untouched.</p>

<p>We all know the solution is simple in theory: plan properly and carve out consistent time—daily, weekly, monthly, yearly—to make progress. How we do it is personal. Some prefer thinking everything through first (top-down), others jump in and figure it out as they go (bottom-up). Some are natural planners, others natural doers. Some delegate, others insist on doing it all themselves.</p>

<p>I’m a strong believer in dreaming big. Every dream, however, comes with a price—not just money, but time, energy, focus, and opportunity cost. That’s why, now and then, we need to put on the accountant’s hat: estimate how long something will really take, how much effort it demands, and whether we’re willing (and able) to pay that cost.</p>

<blockquote>
    In a perfect world, we wouldn’t face harsh limits. But since we do, wise accounting helps us accept reality and shape our dreams to fit within it—without killing the spark.
</blockquote>

<p>Some argue that accounting is only about restrictions. Fair enough. But when was the last time a clear-eyed look at the numbers helped you let go of an unrealistic dream and find peace? Or made you appreciate the quiet joy of smaller, achievable things?</p>

<p>So yes—dream boldly. But every so often, run the numbers. The right balance between dreamer and accountant is what turns distant visions into lives well lived.</p>
